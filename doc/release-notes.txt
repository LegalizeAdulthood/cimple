CIMPLE 0.99.0: 29 March 2007
==============

    1. 	Implemented Pegasus adapter, allowing CIMPLE providers to masquerade 
	as Pegasus C++ providers. This eliminates the need for the Pegasus
	provider manager as well as the patches to the Pegasus provider
	manager loader. It is no longer necessary to patch Pegasus in order
	to load providers. The CIMPLE Provider manager is not considered
	obsolete. 

    2.	Load/Unload of providers now works and uses the Pegasus provider manager
        mechanisms.

    3.	There are no longer special naming requirements for provider libraries
	(previous version required that they start with "cmpl").

    4.	Regmod now automatically detects the provider interface to use
	while registering the provider. A provider either links to
	libcimplepegadap.so or libcimplecmpiadap.so. Regmod searches
	for entry points within these libraries to determine which 
	has been linked.

    5.	The provider timer() operation has been disabled for now until
	a workable CMPI threading model can be found.

    6.	There is no longer any need for a provider to include any CMPI-
	specific header files.

    7.	It is no longer necessary to inject the following macro into the
	provider's module.cpp file:

	    CIMPLE_PEGASUS_PROVIDER_ENTRY_POINT;

    8.	The size of the CMPI adapter library was reduced by hiding all
	of the symbols expect for the single entry point called
	cimple_cmpi_adapter().
