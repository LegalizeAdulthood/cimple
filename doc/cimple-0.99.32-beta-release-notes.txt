                        Version 0.99.32 Release Notes
                        =============================

    1.  The CIMDatetime default constructor now constructs a zero-interval
        ("00000000000000.000000:000") rather than the 1970 POSIX epoch
        ("19700101000000.000000:000").

    2.  Fixed "free memory write" in CMPI provider during provider unload.

    3.  Eliminated use of faulty CMGetCharPtr() macro in CMPI adapter.

    4.  Optimized performance of Pegasus adapter.

    5.  Added -r (repository) option to regmod to override use of the
        use PEGASUS_HOME environment variable for locating the Pegasus
        repository.

    6.  Improved Pegasus repository validation logic in regmod. Eliminated
        mandatory checks for "repository/root#cimv2" since some installations
        have no such directory. Also added validation of repository namespace
        directories (to be sure they have the property subdirectories).

    7.  Improved support for static linking of provider dependent libraries
        on Windows (added cimple/src/providers/Static example to illustrate
        this).

    8.  Fixed CMPI adapter to publish indications on the namespace(s) for
        which there are subscriptions rather than on the hardcoded "root/cimv2"
        namespace.

    9.  Added feature to support vendor customization of the library name.
        Two new environment variabes now enable vendors to append a prefix
        (CIMPLE_LIBRARY_PREFIX) or suffix (CIMPLE_LIBRARY_SUFFIX) to each
        library created by CIMPLE makefiles.

    10. Added MSVC6 (SP5) to the list of supported compilers. Fixed related
        compiler errors.
