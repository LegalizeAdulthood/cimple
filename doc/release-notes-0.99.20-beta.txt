                        Version 0.99.20 Release Notes
                        =============================

    1.  Added provider examples showing how to create persistent instances in 
        the OpenPegasus repository.

    2.  Added CIMPLE_CLASS_DEPENDENCY() macro so providers can declare MOF
        classes that will be registered by regmod. For example, the following
        can be added to a provider's module source file.

            CIMPLE_CLASS_DEPENDENCY(MyClass);

        Note that it is not necessary to define class dependencies for the
        provided classes or any of its related classes since these are
        deduced automatically. This mechanism is mainly used to register
        unrelated classess.

    3.  Added TSD class (thread-specific data).

    4.  Added error reporting scheme to cimom:: interface so the underlying
        error message can be retrieved (CMPI adapter only). For example:

            if (cimom::create_instance(...) != 0)
            {
                printf("Error messagse: %s\n", Error::get());
            }


    5.  Fixed compiler error on GNU C++ 3.X (in Array_Impl.h).
