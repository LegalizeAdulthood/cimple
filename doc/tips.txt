    1.	If a provider returns GET_INSTANCE_UNSUPPORTED from get_instance(), the
	CIMOM uses enum_instances() to find a matching instance.

    2.	If a provider returns ENUM_ASSOCIATOR_NAMES_UNSUPPORTED from 
	enum_assoication_names(), the CIMOM uses enum_instances() satisfy
	the request.

    3.	All provider library names must begin with "cmpl" ("libcmpl" on
	Linux/Unix) in order to be loaded by thye CIMPLE/Pegasus provider
	manager (the provider manager scans the lib directory and only
	considers libraries named this way).
