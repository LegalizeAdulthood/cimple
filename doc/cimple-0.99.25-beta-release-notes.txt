                        Version 0.99.25 Release Notes
                        =============================

    1.  Changed CIMDatetime class so that the zero-interval is the default

    2.  Fixed unload error in CMPI provider (was accessing a mutex that had
        already been destructed).

    3.  Eliminated use of faulty CMGetCharPtr macro in CMPI adapter.

    4.  Optimized performance of Pegasus adapter.

    5.  Added -r (repository) option to regmod to override use of the
        use PEGASUS_HOME environment variable for locating the Pegasus
        repository.

    6.  Improved Pegasus repository validation logic in regmod.

    7.  Reworked logic in regmod that validates the Pegasus directory
        structure so that regmod works better in production environment.

    8.  Improved support for static linking of provider dependent libraries
        on Windows (added cimple/src/providers/Static example to illustrate
        this).
