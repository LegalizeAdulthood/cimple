Cautionary note: if your pegasus environment is set up (i.e., the Pegasus
environment variables are present), CIMPLE will attempt to build Pegasus-
related components. Be sure PEGASUS has been properly cross compiled before
proceeding. If none of the Pegasus environment variables are defined, then
you can build a standalone CIMPLE environment with these instructions as
well.

This document explains how to cross-compile CIMPLE for the PowerPC, with 
HardHat Linux (from MonteVista).

First, define three environment variables as shown:

    % export CXX=/opt/hardhat/devkit/ppc/82xx/bin/ppc_82xx-g++
    % export CC=/opt/hardhat/devkit/ppc/82xx/bin/ppc_82xx-gcc
    % export AR=/opt/hardhat/devkit/ppc/82xx/bin/ppc_82xx-ar

This is to override the native tool-chain with the cross-compiler tool
chain.

Next, edit <cimple-root>/src/cimple/platform.h and uncomment the line
that defines your platform macro. For example:

	#define CIMPLE_PLATFORM_LINUX_PPC_GNU

You must also comment out the other definitions. For example:

	// #define CIMPLE_PLATFORM_LINUX_IX86_GNU

Finally, follow the instructions in build-howto.txt as usual.
