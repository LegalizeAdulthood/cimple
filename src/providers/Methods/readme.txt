The methods provider tests the handling of intrinsic methods with a variety
of arguments.

It defines two classes, Argument, and Methods.  The class Argument is used
only as the argument of a ref type parameter in the Methods provider.

The provider returns a single fixed instance but the primary function is the
testing of method handling.

There are a set of clients for testing in the foo... subdirectories.

This provider is part of the automated testing
