Test client for LargeInstance provider.  This is a simple test that
sets parameters into the provider with the setconfig method and then
call the enumerateInstances to determine if the provider returned the
correct results.

However the real goal is to provide a means to test with very large
instances and large numbers of instances in the response.

Parmeters for the test client can be found by executing the program
with -h option.
