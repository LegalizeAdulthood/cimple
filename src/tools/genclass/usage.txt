Usage: genclass [OPTIONS] [CLASS_NAME]...

This utility generates C++ definitions from MOF classes. For each class-name
argument, it generates at least two files: CLASSNAME.h (containing the 
corresponding C++ class) and CLASSNAME.cpp (containing opaque meta-data for
the class). It also generates header and source files for any dependent 
classes (ancestor and reference classes). The list of class names can be
provided either on the command line and/or with the -F option pointing to
a file containing the class names.

Genclass to process the following MOF files:

    1. 	First CIM_Schema.mof or first file of form cimv[0-9]*.mof (required).
    2. 	Second repository.mof (optional).
    3.	Finally any files given by the -M option (optional).

Genclass requires the CIMPLE_MOF_PATH environment variable to be set, where
it expects to find CIM_Schema.mof or cimv[0-9]*.mof (which contains the CIM 
schema). The syntax of CIMPLE_MOF_PATH is similar to the Linux/Unix PATH 
environment variable (i.e., a list of directories separated by colons). For 
example:

    export CIMPLE_MOF_PATH=/opt/cimple/schema/cim2131:/tmp/cim

Genclass searches for user-defined MOF files in the following way:

    1. 	First in the current directory.
    2. 	Second under $CIMPLE_MOF_PATH.
    3. 	Finally, under directories given by the -I options.

OPTIONS:
    -V      -- print the version number.
    -I path -- add to MOF include path (can be repeated).
    -M file -- add to list of MOF files to be parsed (can be repeated).
    -r      -- generate repository.h and repository.cpp.
    -h      -- Print this message.
    -e      -- Generate enum tags for Values/ValueMap qualifiers.
    -s      -- Generate classes for entire CIM schema.
    -l      -- Export class symbols (for shared libraries).
    -q      -- Generate non-boolean qualifiers and non-description qualifiers.
    -d      -- Generate Description qualifiers.
    -b      -- Generate boolean qualifiers (in addition to bit mask).
    -f file -- Read class names from this file (one per line). (Deprecate)
    -F file -- Read class names from this file (one per line).Same as -f file
    -S      -- Create .genclass file that contains list of generated
               .cpp files.
    -v      -- Generate verbose output of processing by genclass
