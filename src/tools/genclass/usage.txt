Usage: genclass [OPTIONS] <class-names>...

This utility generates C++ definitions from MOF classes. For each class-name
argument, it generates at least two files: CLASSNAME.h (containing the 
corresponding C++ class) and CLASSNAME.cpp (containing opaque meta-data for
the class). It also generates header and source files for any dependent 
classes (ancestor and reference classes).

Genclass to process the following MOF files:

    1. 	First CIM_Schema.mof (required).
    2. 	Second repository.mof (optional).
    3.	Finally any files given by the -M option (optional).

Genclass requires the CIMPLE_MOF_PATH environment variable to be set, where
it expects to find CIM_Schema.mof (which contains the CIM schema). The syntax 
of CIMPLE_MOF_PATH is similar to the Linux/Unix PATH environment variable 
(i.e., a list of directories separated by colons). For example:

    export CIMPLE_MOF_PATH=/opt/cimple/schema/cim211:/tmp/cim

Genclass searches for user-defined MOF files in the following way:

    1. 	First in the current directory.
    2. 	Second under $CIMPLE_MOF_PATH.
    3. 	Finally, under directories given by the -I options.

OPTIONS:
    -I path -- add to MOF include path (can be repeated).
    -M file -- add to list of MOF files to be parsed (can be repeated).
    -r      -- generate repository.h and repository.cpp.
    -v      -- print the version number.
    -h      -- Print this message.
    -e      -- Generate enum tags for Values/ValueMap qualifiers.
    -s      -- Generate classes for entire CIM schema.
    -l      -- Export class symbols (for shared libraries).
