Directory for the common utilities that are part of CIMPLE including the
required utilities such as regmod, genclass, genprov, getmod and a number
of supplementary utilities for development support that MAY NOT be compiled
as part of a normal CIMPLE install.

To install any of the utilities that are not built with the DIRs list in the
Makefile in this directory

go to the appropriate directory:
%%> make
%%> make install

NOTE: The CIMPLE team does not insure that all of these supplementary
utilities work on all CIMPLE platforms since they are primarily for developer
usage.
