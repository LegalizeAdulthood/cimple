 Work tool to get information on providers registered specifically for
 pegasus. This tool is pegasus only because there is no DMTF standard for
 provider registration.

 It uses the Pegasus classes (PG_ProviderModule, PG_Provider, and
 PG_ProviderCapabilities to find information on the providers registered
 for the cim server.

 TODO:  Add more status information to the output
        Extend so we show internal information on CIMPLE providers from
        the shared library.
