Usage: %s [-cvh] provider-module-library [classname...]

Where:
    -V           : print the version
    -c           : create classes (or delete them when -u present)
    -i           : delete indirect classes (when -u and -c present)
    -s           : provide subclasses of the provided class (or delete them
                   with -u)
    -v           : verbose mode
    -n namespace : provider namespace (may occur multiple times)
    -d           : dump the MOF registration instances to standard output
                   without modifying the Pegasus repository.
    -u           : unregister the module
    -U username  : the user to run provider module as (user must be a system
                   user, @requestor, @cimserver, or @privileged).
    -h           : print this help text

Synopsis:
    This utility registers (or unregisters) one more more providers contained
    in a CIMPLE provider module library, with the Pegasus CIMOM. There are two
    forms for registering providers. The following registers ALL providers
    contained in the provider module library.

        $ regmod [OPTIONS] provider-module-library

    Alternatively, the following registers only providers for the classes
    explicitly listed after the provider module library.

        $ regmod [OPTIONS] provider-module-library classname...

    This utility performs the following steps:

    1.  Validates the module library by loading it.
    2.  Checks compatiblity between provider classes and Pegasus classes.
    3.  Creates provider classes in Pegasus repository if they do not exist.
    4.  Registers all providers in the module with the Pegasus repository

    There are three ways to unregister:

    1. regmod -u (delete registration instances only).
    2. regmod -u -c (delete registration instances and direct classes).
    3. regmod -u -c -i (delete registration instances, direct classes, and
       indirect classes).
