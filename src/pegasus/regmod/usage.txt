Synopsis:
    This utility registers (or unregisters) all providers contained in a
    CIMPLE provider module library, with the Pegasus CIMOM. Registration 
    performs the following steps:

    1.  Checks to see if PEGASUS_HOME is defined.
    2.  Checks to see if the Pegasus repository exists.
    3.  Validates the module library by loading it.
    4.  Checks compatiblity between provider classes and Pegasus classes.
    5.  Creates provider classes in Pegasus repository if they do not exist.
    6.  Registers all providers in the module with the Pegasus repository

    There are three ways to unregister:

    1. regmod -u (delete registration instances only).
    2. regmod -u -c (delete registration instances and direct classes).
    3. regmod -u -c -i (delete registration instances, direct classes, and
       indirect classes).
