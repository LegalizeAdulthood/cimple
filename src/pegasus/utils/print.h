/*
    Display functions for Pegasus C++ CIMInstance object.  These functions
    were defined primarily for the Pegasus provider adapter and provide
    display of instances formatted roughly as instance mof.
    Since they are primarily used in the adapter they do not display
    CIMClasses (i.e. the case where an embedded object might be a class).
    These are intended as diagnostic tools and the format of the display
    may change at any time.
    NOTE: These functions are also used in the CIMPLE test clients to
    display instances (i.e. cimple::print(x); where x is CIMInstance x).
    We do not need corresponding functions for CIMObject path because there
    is a toString(...) function in Pegasus.
    TODO: Consider replacing this with Pegasus functions to a) reduce
    size of CIMPLE, become more standard with Pegasus and use Pegasus
    libraries.  The two possibilities are the mof output and the
    Print.h mechanism when that is cleaned up for future Pegasus.

    Includes:
      print - print to cout
      formatToString - Create String with formatted instance. This is
          core function used by print and log.
      log - output to log file
