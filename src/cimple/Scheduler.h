/** This function is called when the timer expires. It passes the arg
    parameter that was initially passed to add_timer(). If this function

    again in n microseconds.

/** This class provides a thread safe interface for scheduling
 *  timed functions. It allows adding schedule items to be
 *  defined that will cause functions to be called as these
 *  functions timeout. The called functions can define whether
 *  the timers are repetitive or terminate by the return value
 *  from the procedure.
 *  
 *  There are three modes of scheduler operation:
 *  \li \c Manual dispatcher usage.  The user executes the
 *      dispatcher in a loop to execute timed functions
 *  
 *  \li \c Manual control of a dispatcher thread.  By creating a
 *  scheduler without parameter (Scheduler x;) a scheduler is
 *  created that uses start_dispatcher to start the dispatcher
 *  thread. This thread runs until either the Scheduler is
 *  destructed or the stop_dispatcher() function is called
 *  
 *  \li \c Auto Dispatching (create with Scheduler sched(true);)
 *  creates a scheduler that starts the dispatcher thread when
 *  there is a timer added to the queue and terminates the
 *  dispatcher thread when the queue is empty.  Note that if a
 *  timer function is executed and returns a non-zero return,
 *  the dispatcher thread is not terminated during this
 *  interval.   This can be useful when the creation of
 *  scheduled function is sporadic so that the dispatcher thread
 *  is not enabled when there is nothing to dispatch.
 *  
 *  Within a single scheduler object, all timed functions run in
 *  a single thread. When a timer expires the scheduler calls
 *  the defined function and when this function terminates it
 *  attempts to evaluate the next function in the timer queue.
 *  
 *  EXAMPLE:
 *  /code
 *  Scheduler sched;
 *
 *  static uint64 _timer(void* arg)
 *  {
 *     const char* str = (const char*)arg;
 *
 *     printf("_timer(%s)\n", str);
 *     return(0);
 *  }
 *  
 *  // function to stop the scheduler
 *  static uint64 _stopScheduler(void* arg)
 *  {
 *      sched.stop_thread()
 *      return 0;
 *  }
 *  // Scheduler call function
 *  sched.add_timer(3 * SEC, _timer, (void*)"3");
 *  sched.add_timer(30 * SEC, _stop_scheduler, value);
 *  
 *  sched.start_dispatcher();
 *  Thread::join(sched.thread_id(), value); /endcode
