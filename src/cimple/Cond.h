/** The Cond class implements a conditional variable, similar to
*   the POSIX-threads conditional variable concept.  A condition
*   variable is used with appropriate functions for waiting and
*   thread continuation. The condition variable mechanism allows
*   threads to suspend execution and relinquish the processor
*   until some condition is true.
*  
*   A condition variable must always be associated with a mutex
*   to avoid a race condition created by one thread preparing to
*   wait and another thread which may signal the condition
*   before the first thread actually waits on it resulting in a
*   deadlock. The thread would be perpetually waiting for a
*   signal that is never sent. Any mutex can be used, there is
*   no explicit link between the mutex and the condition
*   variable.
*  
*   The standard waiter and signaler patterns for conditional
*   variables and their associated mutexes are:
*  
*   # standard "waiter" idiom:
*   \code
*   mutex.lock();
*   while ( !condition )
*        cond.wait( mutex );
*   do_something();
*   mutex.unlock();
*   \endcode
* 
*    # standard "signaler" idiom:
*    \code
*    mutex.lock();
*    // make condition TRUE
*    mutex.unlock();
*    cond.signal();
*    \endcode
*  
*   Conditions may be as simple or complex as the user requires.
*   They need not be single variable or simple comparisons.
*   Thus, for example a condiition could be something like
*   ( queue_size > 10) && (!stop)
*  
*   Signals are not remembered, which means that threads must
*   already be waiting for a signal to receive it. Spurious
*   wakups are allowed by the pthread standard and the signal is
*   simply dropped if there is not waiting thread.
*  
*   Example:
*   \code
*   Cond cond1;
    Mutex mutex1;
    int count = Some Initial value;
    // The take_action is executed when the counter() is called enough times
    // so that count decrements to zero.
    
    action()
    { ...
        mutex1.lock();
*       // action gives up control until condition variable == 0
        while (count <> 0)
            cond1.wait(mutex1);
        
        mutex1.unlock();
        take_action();
    }
 
    counter()
    {
        ...
*       // lock the mutex decrement and test counter 
*       // the lock is used to avoid race conditions
        mutex1.lock();
        count--;
        if (count==0)
            cond1.signal();
        mutex1.unlock();
*   }
*   \endcode
*  
*   Cond implements all of the current POSIX conditional
*   variable operations execpt timed wait.
