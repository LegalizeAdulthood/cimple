//
// The Buffer class implements a simple array of raw types (types that do
// not require construction and deconstruction). It only implements the
// fundamentals:
//   - Append of simple char, string, and integer elements
//   - Insert of simple char* elements within the buffer
//   - Removal of simple char* elements within the buffer
//   - Set of a single character with a method set()
//   - Append of complex elements created with either a format or vformat
//     function based on printf format definitions
//   - Management of the capacity (allocated space) for the buffer with
//     functions to reserve, and see (capacity()) the buffer capacity by
//     allocating or reallocating space for the buffer.
//   - Manipulate the data size in the buffer with grow() and resize(). This
//     manipulates the size parameter without adding data so that the user
//     is responsible for constructing the data in the buffer using memcpy,etc.
//
// Buffer manages the space using the malloc allocator.  It establishes a
// minimum space upon the first insertion of data into the buffer (4096 bytes)
// and expands this if the data input is greater than this size.  The buffer
// space is only allocated when the buffer object is destructed.
//
// Space for data is allocated using an algorithm that reallocates the
// space if the next append or insert will exceed the current capacity. The
// algorithm doubles the  allocated size each time the capacity is
// exceeded. Note that this algorithm does not take into account very
// large buffers so that if the data size gets into the megabyte range, the
// allocator allocates multiple megabytes of space.
//
// WARNING: This class tests for out-of-bound conditions on functions involving
// and index into the buffer (insert, remove, [], etc. but simply executes
// a CIMPLE_ASSERT if these conditions are encountered.
//
// WARNING: This class is intended for internal use within CIMPLE. The
// interface definitions may change so any use by provider writers must
// accept this limitation.
