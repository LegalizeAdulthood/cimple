This change log was started effective with version 2.00

2.00, November 2008 (Public Release)
	* Add wmi support. See wmi.pdf for information.
2.01  December 2008 (Beta Private release)
        * Add support for upcall defintions with concrete objects.
		  Not yet documented. See provider src/providers/methodUpcall
		  for working example of the change
	* Correction to WMI_Thread_Context.cpp and .h
	* Changed. Atomic.cpp, cimple/Thread_Context, cimple/cimom.*
	  cimple/log.cpp, cmpi/adapter/CMPIContainers.cpp, etc.
	  Tags are: cimple_2_0_0 to cimple_2_0_1-start

2.02  Never generated.
	NOTE: Odd number releases are considered private (ex. beta) releases
	for selected users, test, etc.  Even number releases are offical 
	updates for public distribution.

2.03  24 January 2009 (beta private release)
	* Fix several problems including:
	    1. Memory loss from CMPIAdapter.cpp for associator
		   operations. Not consistently destroying instances.
		2. Invalid Class exception from CMPIAdapter.cpp on
		   association requests. Changed to OK.
		3. Test wmi adapter against multiple windows OS and
		   correct issues with compiler errors resulting
		   from differences between the windows compilers
		   and SDKs. In particular corrected compile errors
		   in Atomic_WIN32_IX86_MSVC.h with Interlock functions
		   and WMI_Adapter.h use of Rpcsal.h
		4. Modify wmi repository.mof to eliminate issue of
		   special wmi qualifiers and restore original DMTF
		   qualifiers.mof.  In the future, providers requiring
		   these qualifiers will include the qualifiers in as
		   specific extensions for wmi. For now, they are attached
		   to the repository.mof for each provider.
	* Extend tests and test providers including All Provider,
	  Widget Provider. Added more tests to autmated tests
	  including All and All/TestAll.
	* Continue development of Doxygen documentation of header
	  files.
	* Correct wmi.pdf documentation.
	* Add platform definitions for SOLARIS_IX86_CC,
	  SOLARIS_IX86_CC  SOLARIS_SPARC_CC and SOLARIS_SPARC_64_CC
	* Added code to regmod.cpp to output NOCHKSRC line in 
	  module.cpp files.  Would not pass pegasus chksrc without
	  this.

	NOTE: Work started with tag cimple_2_0_1-start (equal to 
	final_mbrasher_tag). It ended with cimple-2_0_3-end tag.
2.04 Not Generated

2.05 8 February 2009
	* Add new CIMPLE_Status return codes to match the DMTF Specification.
	  Added statuscodes for ACCESS_DENIED, INVALID_PARAMETER to bring
	  the available status codes in line with DMTF DSP0200.
        * Corrected Error in CMPI and Pegasus adapters that did not allow
	  cross namespace associations. They were returning the request
	  namespace rather than the namespace defined in the association.
	  NOTE: This error was apparently introduced in V 2.0.
	* Integrated automated test for cross namespace associations with
	  testclient under Cross provider.
	* Added provider (OperationContext) to test correctness of CIMPLE
	  status return codes.
	* Extended All_Class test provider.
	* Added comments to Makefiles generated by genmak and also ability
	  to generate selected targets (regmod).
       	Release tag cimple_2_0_5
	* Add get_username() function as an experimental function to get
	  the username from the CIMServer.  This works with CMPI and Pegasus
	  for this release.  Note that the interface may change.
	* Rebuild the Hello provider. It had not been build for a long time
	  and the module.cpp was not compatible with the current common 
	  functions. Added calls for allow_unload and get_username() to this
	  provider although they only demo the action, not test the result.
       	Release tag cimple_2_0_5
2.06 10 March 2009
    * Clean up comments on cimple header files and integrate into doxygen
	* add size function to cimple/Lists.h
	* Restore List and Scheduler functions to src/cimple along with tests.
	  These functions are conditionally compiled since they are experimental
	  so we modified configure to add a --enable-scheduler option.
	  We may leave this since compiling without this is a bit smaller.
	* Extended Upcall provider for more complete testing
	* extended cimple/tests/value test
    * moved some command aliases to config.mak
	* Extended tests for Cond_Queue function in cimple/tests
	* Added more tests to cimple/tests Makefile
	* Added readme to more providers
    * Fixed issue where a configure command did not update the options.h file.
        Only if the user did a make disclean removing the options.h file would
        the options.h file be update.  Now, this file will be updated each time
        configure is run.
    * Updated Using_CIMPLE.pdf file to version 2
