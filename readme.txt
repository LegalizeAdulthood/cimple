This subdirectory tree contains the CIMPLE distribution. It is currently 
a work in progress. It comprises the following components:

    1. Full MOF compiler.

    2. Class generator (generates metadata for a given MOF class).

    3. Provider generator (generates a provider skeleton for a MOF class).

    4. The CIMPLE provider layer.

    5. Sample CIMPLE providers.

Currently only Linux is supported. But Unix POSIX platforms are easy to support
as well.

Today documentation is in a preliminary form. The documentation is contained in
the CIMPLE doc directory. The documentation includes :

    build-howto.txt - Building and integration instructions for CIMPLE.
    provider-howto.txt - Overview on writing a provider in CIMPLE
