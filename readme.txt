CIMPLE is an environment for developing providers that interoperate with 
several CIM server implementations. A provider developed with CIMPLE 
transparently supports the following provider interfaces:

    - OpenGroup CMPI Interface
    - OpenPegasus C++ Interface
    - OpenWBEM C++ Interface

CIMPLE greatly reduces the effort of developing providers with source code
generation and automation tools. For a complete description, see the following
